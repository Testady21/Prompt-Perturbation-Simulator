Answer according to: As a result of performing IV&V (Independent Verification and Validation) on Space Station software, a number of interface faults were found during integrated testing or actual software deployment. Faults found at this late phase of the software development lifecycle are very expensive to fix. Other research indicates that significant cost savings can be realized if these types of faults can be discovered at earlier software development lifecycle phases, such as specification or coding. A need was determined for processes, procedures, and tools that will reliably identify interface faults during these earlier software development lifecycle phases. The ability to perform interface validation during earlier phases will reduce costly fixes due to interface faults discovered during later software development phases.\nThe approach is to leverage insight gained through analysis of real interface faults to develop analytical approaches for identifying interface faults in various types of artifacts, including specifications and source code. The unique contribution of this technology is the model-based representation of interface information that permits semi-automated analysis. Currently, interface analysis is largely manual and therefore time-consuming and expensive. Functional operation is to capture interface information from text-based artifacts into a model-based representation. Once in a model-based representation, consistency checks and flow analysis are performed to identify potential interface faults.\nThe technology has widespread applicability in any kind of software development that uses distributed applications. It is particularly applicable to critical real-time systems because interface faults in these systems can be catastrophic."

Queen Uberta begins to prepare Alise to learn how to be and act like a princess. But Alise doesn't want to be a princess in this way but to be a modern princess. Lord Rogers says that Alise needs adventure but Queen Uberta disagrees. While fighting once again, Alise uses her chance to swim in the lake with her friends but she was quickly sent back to the palace to learn to be proper. Queen Uberta is very strict with Alise, trying to teach her everything, but instead she falls asleep and sent to bed. That same night, Lord Rogers, Jean-Bob, and Speed sneak Alise out of her room to go on an adventure. The next morning, before Queen Uberta enters Alise's room with yoga lessons, she notices that Alise has gone with Lord Rogers. Queen Uberta chases after the group all the way to the port but they escape on a ship. Queen Uberta is furious but nervous about Alise so she sent Puffin and the Scullions after them. On the ship, Alise changes into a pirate costume, making Lord Rogers realize that Uberta was right; he turned Alise into a pirate just when Alise wanted to have fun.

But as you will hear in this chat we had, he sees the world with a breadth and intellectual hunger.

The official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said Trump offered to lift sanctions against it as relations improve, indicating a phased-in approach where concessions would be provided at various stages of the denuclearization process. Speaking at a news conference in Seoul alongside South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-hwa and Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono, the U.S. secretary of state said the Trump administration would not repeat the mistakes made by past presidents that rewarded Pyongyang for denuclearization promises. “When we refer to the mistakes of the past. They were providing economic and financial aid relief before the complete denuclearization had taken place. That is not going to happen. President Trump made that clear,” Pompeo said. President Trump described his meeting with Kim as a resounding success and in a tweet said, “There is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea.” But the U.S.-North Korea joint declaration was vague on details, providing no clear definition on what constitutes denuclearization, set no timeline for the dismantlement process, and said nothing about outside verification requirements. Pompeo, however, pointed out that in the Singapore statement both countries reaffirmed the inter-Korean Panmunjom declaration from April, in which both South and North Korea agreed to uphold all past agreements that did specify detailed nuclear prohibitions and verification requirements. The secretary of state and his counterparts in Seoul and Tokyo said they are united in support of the U.S.-North Korea agreement, and in agreement on the goal of complete, irreversible, verifiable dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear program. After the summit,... Who did Trump meet with representing North Korea? - not enough information - Mike Pompeo - Taro Kono - Kim Jong Un\nThe answer to this question is:"

Macy) has little positive going for him: he lives in a dreary place--a studio apartment in a run-down motel near the Las Vegas Strip; he can't recall the last time he had physical contact with a woman; he's indebted to the Shangri-La casino boss Shelly Kaplow (Alec Baldwin), who years earlier cured him of a gambling habit by breaking his kneecap. Kaplow had also paid Lootz' casino debts, and Bernie has been working off that large debt to Shelly for several years and the debt is nearly paid off. Lootz is weary of the casino business, and tells Kaplow he is leaving Las Vegas soon. His future success as a luck \"cooler\" is changed when cocktail waitress Natalie Belisario (Maria Bello) seemingly takes an interest in him, and his luckÂ â and that of those around himÂ â takes a turn for the better. What Bernie doesn't know yet is that Shelly has paid Natalie to seduce him into staying and working at the Shangri-La. What Shelly doesn't know is that Natalie actually has fallen in love with Bernie, and vice versa. Additional complications arise when Shelly, a relative old-timer who resents the Disneyfication of Vegas, resists the efforts of new Shangri-La owner advisers, including Ivy League graduate and condescending upstart Larry Sokolov (Ron Livingston), to update the casino hotel property and bring it into the 21st century. Lootz also learns his seldom-seen adult son is back in town, and, with his wife, is interfering with the operations at the Shangri La. Though Shelly still has the backing of certain mob associates, such as gangster Nicky Fingers, the growing power of the new young Ivy League casino owners is lessening his power grip on the casino and the business he truly loves.\nA:"

His address was the first of two speeches the president is scheduled to make this week to frame his administration's ongoing response to the recession, less than two months ahead of midterm elections in which Democratic majorities in the House and Senate are in jeopardy. \"Today, I am announcing a new plan for rebuilding and modernizing America's roads, and rails and runways for the long term,\" said Obama, who spoke on Labor Day in Milwaukee, Wisconsin -- a state with competitive gubernatorial and U.S. Senate races. \"We used to have the best infrastructure in the world. We can have it again,\" he said to loud cheers from a crowd of union workers. The proposal envisions -- over a six year period -- rebuilding 150,000 miles of roads, 4,000 miles of rail and 150 miles of airport runways. It also would include modernizing the nation's air traffic control system in an effort to reduce delays and travel time. \"This will not only create jobs immediately. It's also going to make our economy hum over the long haul,\" said the president. Obama hopes to work with Congress to enact an up-front investment of $50 billion -- an amount a White House statement said would represent a significant chunk of new spending on infrastructure. The investment would then be paired with what the administration called a framework to improve transportation spending. The long-term plan would include the establishment of an Infrastructure Bank, which would leverage federal dollars and focus on projects that could deliver the the biggest bang for the buck, Obama said. The president stressed the need for Democrats and Republicans to work together on the transportation initiative, which would need to be approved by Congress. \n\nBased on the paragraph, does the response \"More jobs, better commute times\" correctly answer the question \"What did the president say would be two significant benefits of spending to rebuild many miles of roads, railways, and runways?\"?"

Once he arrived, prosecutors say he had second thoughts. \"When he realized the hunt was on, the defendant blinked\" and sent it back, rolling it up \"in a manner befitting a college dorm-room poster.\" Among the evidence detectives are said to have uncovered in the case: Istavriglou's fingerprint on the mailing tube, relevant Web searches made from his Google account before the story broke, and a photo of the drawing in the gallery that he posted to his Facebook page. Istavrioglou was caught after an undercover cop posed as a New York art gallery manager and offered him a job, returning him to the Big Apple. He's due back in court today, the New York Times notes."

Disraeli's expansionist foreign policy, which Victoria endorsed, led to conflicts such as the Anglo-Zulu War and the Second Anglo-Afghan War. \"If we are to maintain our position as a first-rate Power\", she wrote, \"we must ... be Prepared for attacks and wars, somewhere or other, CONTINUALLY.\" Victoria saw the expansion of the British Empire as civilising and benign, protecting native peoples from more aggressive powers or cruel rulers: \"It is not in our custom to annexe countries\", she said, \"unless we are obliged & forced to do so.\" To Victoria's dismay, Disraeli lost the 1880 general election, and Gladstone returned as prime minister. When Disraeli died the following year, she was blinded by \"fast falling tears\", and erected a memorial tablet \"placed by his grateful Sovereign and Friend, Victoria R.I.\"\nWhat position did Victoria take on how to be a successful and top notch power?"

        "prompt": "Even after  Bin Laden's departure from the area, CIA officers hoped he might return, seeing the camp as a magnet that could draw him for as long as it was still set up. The military maintained readiness for another strike opportunity. On March 7, 1999, Clarke called a UAE official to express his concerns about possible associations between Emirati officials and  Bin Laden. Clarke later wrote in a memorandum of this conversation that the call had been approved at an interagency meeting and cleared with the CIA. When the former  Bin Laden unit chief found out about Clarke's call, he questioned CIA officials, who denied having given such a clearance. Imagery confirmed that less than a week after Clarke's phone call the camp was hurriedly dismantled, and the site was deserted. CIA officers, including Deputy Director for Operations Pavitt, were irate.\" Mike\" thought the dismantling of the camp erased a possible site for targeting  Bin Laden. The United Arab Emirates was becoming both a valued counterterrorism ally of the United States and a persistent counterterrorism problem. From 1999 through early 2001, the United States, and President Clinton personally, pressed the UAE, one of the Taliban's only travel and financial outlets to the outside world, to break off its ties and enforce sanctions, especially those relating to flights to and from Afghanistan. These efforts achieved little before 9/11. In July 1999, UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Hamdan bin Zayid threatened to break relations with the Taliban over  Bin Laden. The Taliban did not take him seriously, however. Bin Zayid later told an American diplomat that the UAE valued its relations with the Taliban because the Afghan radicals offered a counterbalance to \"Iranian dangers\" in the region, but he also noted that the UAE did not want to upset the United States. \n\nQuestion: \"Why did Hamdan bin Zayid's threat to break relations with the Taliban achieve little results before 9/11?\"\n\nResponse: \"UAE\"\nAvailable choices:\n(a). no\n(b). yes\nDoes the response correctly answer the question?\n\n"

Would love to hear other suggestions or feedback if you’ve tried one of these products or have one of the books.\nMichael Ruhlman remains one of our better food writers and thinkers, but he’s also on the persnickety side of things. Go watch “Stupid Kitchen Tools” for a good sample-rant. But he’s always put a lot of thought into his opinions, so when he launched a line of kitchen tools I was pretty sure they wouldn’t, you know, be stupid. A few I’m interested in.\nOffset spoon set – No more tasting spoons sliding into the bowl. Brilliant.\nPerforated egg spoon – I have one of these that works well enough but the handle is way too long in my opinion and the bowl itself too shallow. Ruhlman’s got the right idea here.\nThe Kitchen Tool Bundle includes those, a set of (non-stupid) wooden paddles. See also: bamboo pot scrubbers, offset soup spoons and more at his full products website.\nAll-Clad 8” pan – I have and love my 12″ All-Clad pan – which is just a complete, all-around workhorse – but something smaller for omelets, lunch leftovers, etc. Would be great. This’d be my pick.\nDemeyere 3.5 qt. Saucier pan – This is a pricey dude, and they don’t seem to have the more bare-bones version I bought 10+ years ago for sale anymore, but I use this weekly and if you can afford it, I think you will too. Indispensable for risottos, sauces and much more."

Question: What type of animal did he find buried alive? Title: Antichrist Movie plot: Prologue[edit] A couple makes passionate love, as their toddler, Nic, climbs up to the bedroom window and falls to his death. Chapter One: Grief[edit] The mother collapses at the funeral, and spends the next month in the hospital crippled with atypical grief. The father, a therapist, is skeptical of the psychiatric care she is receiving and takes it upon himself to treat her personally with psychotherapy. But it is not successful, and so when she reveals that her second greatest fear is nature, he decides to try exposure therapy. They hike to their isolated cabin in a woods called Eden, where she spent time with Nic the previous summer while writing a thesis on gynocide. He encounters a doe which shows no fear of him, and has a stillborn fawn hanging halfway out of her. Chapter Two: Pain (Chaos Reigns)[edit] During sessions of psychotherapy, she becomes increasingly grief stricken and manic, often demanding forceful sex to escape the pain. The area becomes increasingly sinister to the man, including acorns rapidly pelting the metal roof, awakening with a hand covered in swollen ticks, and finding a self-disemboweling fox that tells him, \"chaos reigns.\" Chapter Three: Despair (Gynocide)[edit] In the dark attic the man finds the womanâs thesis studies: terrifying pictures of witch-hunts, and a scrapbook in which her writing becomes increasingly frantic and illegible. She reveals that while writing her thesis, she came to believe that all women are inherently evil. The man is repulsed by this and reproaches her for buying into the gynocidal beliefs she had originally set out to criticize. In a frenzied moment, they have violent intercourse at the base of an ominous dead tree, where bodies are intertwined within the exposed roots. He suspects that Satan is her greatest, and hidden fear. Through the autopsy and old photos, he becomes aware that she had been systematically putting Nicâs shoes on the wrong feet, resulting in pain and deformity. She attacks him, accuses him of planning to leave her, mounts him,...\nAnswer:"

Each recipe has been lovingly researched, leading Jenny on a road of discovery about her ancestors, with her grandmothers’ legacy continuing to assist in providing clues to their rich and eventful past.\nWinner of “Best in World Cookbook 2017” by the Gourmand World Cookbook Society, Jenny is continuing drawing crowds and growing awareness of both the Anglo Indian Cuisine and her family heritage through her book talks and cookery classes and is now affiliated to the Women’s Institute Headquarters, Denman College as their Anglo Indian tutor.\nHer tour of India in December 2015 appeared to have been orchestrated by some magic wand, whether it was Bangalore or Calcutta, Bombay or Madras, Delhi or Pondicherry, Jenny had well-nigh the best reception that one could ever get – in terms of locale, agenda or audience response.

All first borns are of course heralded by portents and shooting stars, covens of good fairies rushing to endow health, wealth, Einsteinian intelligence, beauty and undiluted happiness, but few are lucky enough to have a sonnet to commemorate the event as well.\nIt’s an amazingly literal poem when one comes to think about it, though in fact they did both manage to be born in the same century, if at the very farthest ends of it. The oceans though are all too real, and those whom he so dearly loved, (myself his daughter, & my husband John) do indeed love Hannah.\nThe poem arrived in an ordinary blue foldover airmail letter, and I have found no working notes to chart its course, indeed it seems it was the manuscript.

Without predation, herbivores began to over-graze many woody browse species, affecting the area's plant populations.

The removal of wolves had a direct effect on beaver populations, as their habitat became territory for grazing. Furthermore, predation keeps hydrological features such as creeks and streams in normal working order. Increased browsing on willows and conifers along Blacktail Creek due to a lack of predation caused channel incision because they helped slow the water down and hold the soil in place.\nWhat changes happened when herbivores were eliminated in Yellowstone?

        "prompt": "Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: As we all know, the ocean moves. But waves breaking on the beach make the ocean fun. When you stand on the shore and look at the waves, it seems like the water is moving towards you. But the water is not really moving forward. The moving you see is wave energy. And wave energy comes from the wind. Let's think about how this works. As wave energy passes through the water, the energy makes particles   of water move up and down. Just give you an example of a wave passing under a basketball. We put a basketball on the sea. When the wind blows, a wave comes from behind the basketball. The basketball moves up to the top with the wave. Then the wave continues and leaves the basketball behind. The basketball looks lower, but it doesn't move forward. That's because the wave energy just moves the water which is under the basketball. So why can you see a wave knock you down on the shore?When a wave moves toward the shore, the bottom of the wave slows down because _ meets the ocean floor. But the top, which is called crest , keeps moving. The different action causes the wave to fall over or break onto the shore. If a wave is very large, it carries a lot of energy when it hits the land. As time goes by, waves can break up and carry away the rocks and other things on the shore. Shorelines are changing all the time because of wave action. Question: Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage? Options: A: Wave energy comes from the water. B: Large waves carry plenty of energy. C: Wave action makes shorelines change all the time. D: The bottom of the wave is easy to slow down.\nAnswer:"

Not surprisingly the rules of arbitration create an alternate system of privatized justice that largely favors the business interests.

Plan ahead, and build your knowledge base about the topics you’re studying for work or school. Additionally, get all of your assignments finished before they’re due. Keep a planner or use the calendar in your phone to help yourself stay on top of things. Maintain good posture by standing up straight and pressing your shoulders back. Smile, keep your arms at your sides, and look at your surroundings. When you talk to people, focus on your talents and achievements, not your flaws. If you want to increase your confidence, do something small every day that makes you feel accomplished. You can also do more things you enjoy and take calculated risks. For example, you might try out for a sports team, enter an art show, or volunteer to take the lead on a project. Punctuality is essential if you want to appear serious and professional. Always be on time or early for things. Set an alarm or calendar entry on your phone to help you remember when you need to be places. Everyone encounters obstacles at one time or another. If you’re going to be late due to an emergency or unforeseen event, call ahead and let people know. Say exactly what you mean, and ask for what you need. Always be kind and respectful when you provide feedback, but don’t be vague because you think it will spare someone’s feelings. Additionally, don’t say more than you need to say.  Don’t expect people to guess what you’re thinking. If it’s important, just tell them. Let's say you're working on a group project and think one person is holding up your progress. You might say, \"Our group project is coming along, but I'm worried you aren't going to be finished with your part on time. Can you get it finished by tomorrow?\" Avoid meaningless chatter, as talking too much can make people see you as unprofessional. Additionally, speaking less often will make your words carry more impact. Keep it professional by only sharing your best thoughts and ideas. For example, don’t add to workplace gossip or chat about topics like TV shows and sports. However, do speak up when you know the answer to a question or when you have a great idea to share. Appearing to be unsure can make you look unprofessional or flaky. At the same time, you’re not going to have all of the answers. To protect your image, respond positively but buy yourself some time to think about what you’ll do or say next. You might say, “That’s a really great point. I’m going to think that over today and get back to you tomorrow with my response,” or “I appreciate your feedback. It’s given me a lot to think about.” Talking about your personal life too often or at the wrong times can make you look less professional. At the same time, talking about your life may help you bond with others. Choose the right times to share personal details about yourself, such as during lunch, breaks, and post-work or after-school events. During work hours or class, stick to topics related to work or school, as well as current events. Similarly, don’t gossip about others’ personal lives. People may perceive you as immature and unprofessional. If your friends or coworkers are gossiping, change the subject. You might say, “All I’m thinking about right now is our project that’s due next week. Have any of you started?” Do what you say you’ll do, when you say you’ll do it. Write all of your tasks and appointments in a planner or the calendar in your phone to keep track of everything. That way, nothing will be forgotten. If you don’t follow through, people won’t respect you because they’ll perceive you as being immature and unprofessional.\n\nWhat is a summary?"

Buffalo regained the lead as Lindell got a 39-yard field goal, while rookie CB Leodis McKelvin returned an interception 64 yards for a touchdown.  The Chiefs struck back with kicker Connor Barth getting a 45-yard field goal, yet the Bills continued their offensive explosion as Lindell got a 34-yard field goal, along with QB Trent Edwards getting a 15-yard TD run. In the third quarter, Buffalo continued its poundings with Edwards getting a 5-yard TD run, while Lindell got himself a 38-yard field goal.  Kansas City tried to rally as Thigpen completed a 45-yard TD pass to WR Mark Bradley, yet the Bills replied with Edwards completing an 8-yard TD pass to WR Josh Reed.  In the fourth quarter, Buffalo pulled away as Edwards completed a 17-yard TD pass to TE Derek Schouman.  The Chiefs tried to come back as QB Quinn Gray completed a 3-yard TD pass to WR Dwayne Bowe, yet the Bills' lead was too much for Kansas City to overcome. This marked the first time the Bills scored 50+ points on an opponent since Sept. 1991 against the Pittsburgh Steelers (52-34).\nQuestion: How many yards long was the shortest touchdown in the first 2 quarters?\nStudent:"

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \"In addition to the classical restaurants, Paris has several other kinds of traditional eating places. The café arrived in Paris in the 17th century, when the beverage was first brought from Turkey, and by the 18th century Parisian cafés were centres of the city's political and cultural life. The Cafe Procope on the Left Bank dates from this period. In the 20th century, the cafés of the Left Bank, especially Café de la Rotonde and Le Dôme Café in Montparnasse and Café de Flore and Les Deux Magots on Boulevard Saint Germain, all still in business, were important meeting places for painters, writers and philosophers. A bistro is a type of eating place loosely defined as a neighbourhood restaurant with a modest decor and prices and a regular clientele and a congenial atmosphere. Its name is said to have come in 1814 from the Russian soldiers who occupied the city; \"bistro\" means \"quickly\" in Russian, and they wanted their meals served rapidly so they could get back their encampment. Real bistros are increasingly rare in Paris, due to rising costs, competition from cheaper ethnic restaurants, and different eating habits of Parisian diners. A brasserie originally was a tavern located next to a brewery, which served beer and food at any hour. Beginning with the Paris Exposition of 1867; it became a popular kind of restaurant which featured beer and other beverages served by young women in the national costume associated with the beverage, particular German costumes for beer. Now brasseries, like cafés, serve food and drinks throughout the day.\"?\nAnswer:"

So I thought this would be really easy to find. Oh, how little did I know!\nI searched for hours and days on end across shopping centres and boutiques to try and find a quality, affordable and trendy piece of kid's sterling silver, then looked online and couldn’t find anything that was suitable for a small little girl, but came out empty-handed.\nThus began my journey to design and produce beautiful, luxurious sterling silver jewellery necklaces and bracelets, sized JUST for kids and tweens, and in a way that THEY can design, personalise and interchange their own designs. Also, I am very strict with the quality control, and create each piece so that it is durable and strong.\nAs a very practical Mother, (raising two little ones on my own), I wanted the children's jewellery to be high quality and affordable, but also grow with children. So, I made each piece fully adjustable to grow with children. I use lead free and nickel free premium .925 sterling silver and heavy 18 karat gold plating on our rose gold and yellow gold pieces, so the children's jewellery is built to last.\nWe hope your girls LOVE wearing the My Little Silver jewellery as much as I enjoyed designing them!"

Freeze the rest and use it as a garnish for this ice cream or other desserts.\nPreheat the oven to 100°C. Dry the orange zest for 3 hours, then grind to a fine powder.\nTo make the praline, put the sugar and water in a saucepan and heat slowly until the sugar dissolves, stirring occasionally. Bring to the boil and cook for about 5 minutes, until the syrup reaches the thread stage (when a drop of syrup falls from a wooden spoon in a long thread) at about 110°C.\nStir in the almonds. The syrup will crystallise and harden as the oils are released from the nuts. Lower the heat and stir patiently until it redissolves to a smooth caramel. This will take 10 minutes or so.\nCarefully pour the caramel onto a baking tray lined with baking paper. Smooth it out, sprinkle the ground orange zest over the praline and then leave it to cool and harden. When the praline is completely cold, bash it with a rolling pin to break it into chunks, then pound it to crumbs in a mortar and pestle. The praline should be the consistency of coarse breadcrumbs.\nMake the ice cream base and chill in the refrigerator. Pour the chilled mixture into an ice cream machine and churn, according to the manufacturer’s instructions, until nearly set. Add half the almond and orange praline towards the end of the churning time. Based on the passage above, Can you suggest alternative desserts that the leftover praline can be used as a garnish for?"

Our expectations for Amy's upcoming album of \"jukebox stuff\" have been raised. ||||| When it was announced that the first bit of music the world would hear from Amy Winehouse after all that tabloid trouble would be a cover of Lesley Gore's \"It's My Party” for a Quincy Jones tribute album, Vulture found it just a touch uninspiring. But now the cover is actually here, and it's tough not to get carried away. Winehouse lets it fly on the Mark Ronson–produced do-over — turning in a dialed-in, muscular vocal performance that moves effortlessly from louche to anguished — and sounds not even a tiny bit horribly addicted to drugs while doing so. No word on an official Back to Black follow-up or anything, of course, but there is one other potentially positive sign: Winehouse has gone from tweeting stuff like “ronson you're dead to me; one album i write an you take half the credit — make a career out of it? don't think so BRUV” to things like “can't find me bleedin notebooks — theyve done a runsies xxxxxxxx LOVE YOU RONSON XXXXXXxxxxxxxxx.” ||||| Image Credit: Samir Hussein/Getty ImagesIf there’s something we know our beloved little wayward beehive enjoys, it’s a good party. And apparently, this one ends in tears. \n  \n The 27-year-old Grammy winner returned to the studio recently for the star-strewn Quincy Jones release Q: Soul Bossa Nostra, due November 9, with her Back to Black producer (and recent subject of a Wino tweet-spanking) Mark Ronson. \n  \n You can hear their recording of Lesley Gore’s 1963 teenage cri de coeur “It’s My Party” \n  \n over at NYmag.com (via Soundcloud). The RonHouse pairing proves as Spector-esquely fruitful as ever—though frankly, whether the reasons are stylistic or substance-related, Amy’s penchant for slurring her vocals yields something closer to “Ish My Parrry.” \n  \n What do you think? Tell us in the comments section below. \n  \n (Follow The Music Mix on Twitter: @EWMusicMix.) \n  \n More on Amy Winehouse: \n  \n Amy Winehouse to Mark Ronson: ‘You’re dead to me’ \n  \n Amy Winehouse to sing ‘It’s My Party’ for Quincy Jones |||||  \n  \n In April we reported that Amy Winehouse and Mark Ronson were working together again, on three tracks for a Quincy Jones tribute album. Well, this is apparently a leaked version of one of their tracks, a cover of It's My Party (Jones's first big hit when he produced the Lesley Gore original in 1963). \n  \n It's not – how can we say this? – the most coherent vocal ever laid to tape, although if there's ever a song where you can let it all go a bit runny-mascara-and-10-Bacardi-Breezers then this is it.

Our book today is Vivid: Poems & Notes About Color by Julie Paschkis, a delightfully quirky look at all our favorite hues.\nUsing a loose structure, nearly each spread is dedicated to a color, except when two colors share one, or one color gets two in a row. The accompanying poems are almost exclusively free-verse, keeping the language short, simple, and easily accessible for readers of all ages. Eccentric topics of verse range from diving into an ocean that becomes bluer the deeper one goes, a cat and dog discussing various shades of red paint colors, and an artichoke-dragon-giant foodchain. Each page also features a nonfiction fact or point of interest on the featured color, such as the etymology of the word “green” or an explanation of why purple is associated with royalty.\nVery interesting! Let’s face it: with the breadth of color books out there, it’s always nice to see one that stands out, and this one does. The poems are unique and original, yet still very child-friendly for the most part. And the illustrations, rich with pigment and graceful, flowing figures, are beautiful and fun. The length is great, and we easily finished the entire book in a single storytime (not always the case with poetry books). And of course, JJ loved finding the colors and animals throughout. A fresh take on a well-loved subject, and we appreciated it. Baby Bookworm approved!\nWhat makes Vivid stand out from other color books, according to the review?"

Here is the video for the single DOG TAGS, featuring Swave Sevah (TeamHOMI) & Akir. This song, produced by Southpaw, is fast and furious in delivery, with the Rebel Arms crew pulling no punches as they attack the industry. The video, shot in an abandoned prison in Newark, by Alex F. Ghosan, compliments it well. If CF was on lockdown previously, this song is definitely a prison break.\nCheck out Constant Flow’s debut album, ‘Ascension‘, also featuring Immortal Technique and Chino XL among others, available direct from Viper Records, iTunes or on CD from UGHH.\nTeamHOMI doesn’t just rep for battling, as those who have checked out Swave Sevah’s recent album Son of A One Armed ManÂ orÂ PH’s Know The Ledge, surely must know. This time with some heat it’s Bugz, with a heartfelt trip down memory lane,Â “Used To Be”. The way he flips the words “used to” will keep you listening, as he gets deep, rapping about growing up conflicted.Â “Smart enough to stand out, but dumb enough to wanna fit in,” BugzÂ vents over a lamentful Meek Mills track, with a soulful chorus. AÂ good student, but poor and struggling to eat, with a crack addicted mother, among other things,Â BugzÂ turned to that life, to increase his dividends. Bugz makes us feel his pain.\nDirected byÂ @Capnels, the black and white video has a nostalgic effect,Â with a cameo from crew memberÂ Swave Sevah."

Brick was the ordinary building material, and with it cities, forts, temples and houses were constructed. The city was provided with towers and stood on an artificial platform; the house also had a tower-like appearance. It was provided with a door which turned on a hinge, and could be opened with a sort of key; the city gate was on a larger scale, and seems to have been double. The foundation stones — or rather bricks — of a house were consecrated by certain objects that were deposited under them.\"\n\nWhat were the foundation stones of Sumerian houses consecrated by?"

        "prompt": "Allen was born Allan Stewart Konigsberg in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, New York. He and his sister, Letty (b. 1943), were raised in Midwood, Brooklyn. He is the son of Nettie (nee Cherry; November 8, 1906 - January 27, 2002), a bookkeeper at her family's delicatessen, and Martin Konigsberg (December 25, 1900 - January 8, 2001), a jewelry engraver and waiter. His family was Jewish, and his grandparents immigrated to the US from Russia and Austria and spoke Yiddish, Hebrew, and German.\n\nIn 1966, Allen wrote the play Don't Drink the Water. The play starred Lou Jacobi, Kay Medford, Anita Gillette and Allen's future movie co-star Tony Roberts. A film adaptation of the play, directed by Howard Morris, was released in 1969, starring Jackie Gleason. Because he was not particularly happy with the 1969 film version of his play, in 1994, Allen directed and starred in a second version for television, with Michael J. Fox and Mayim Bialik.  The next play Allen wrote for Broadway was Play It Again, Sam, in which he also starred. The play opened on February 12, 1969, and ran for 453 performances. It featured Diane Keaton and Roberts. The play was significant to Keaton's budding career, and she has stated she was in \"awe\" of Allen even before auditioning for her role, which was the first time she met him. During an interview in 2013, Keaton stated that she \"fell in love with him right away,\" adding, \"I wanted to be his girlfriend so I did something about it.\" After co-starring alongside Allen in the subsequent film version of Play It Again, Sam, she would later co-star in Sleeper, Love and Death, Interiors, Manhattan and Annie Hall. \"He showed me the ropes and I followed his lead. He is the most disciplined person I know. He works very hard,\" Keaton has stated. \"I find the same thing sexy in a man now as I always have: humor. I love it when they are funny. It's to die for.\"  For its March 21, 1969, issue, Life featured Allen on its cover. In 1981, his play The Floating Light Bulb premiered on Broadway and ran for 65 performances. While receiving mixed reviews, it gave an autobiographical insight into Allen's childhood, specifically his fascination with magic tricks. He has written several one-act plays, including Riverside Drive and Old Saybrook exploring well-known Allen themes.  On October 20, 2011, Allen's one-act play Honeymoon Motel opened as part of a larger piece entitled Relatively Speaking on Broadway, with two other one-act plays, one by Ethan Coen and one by Elaine May.\n\nAnswer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Did he write anything else?"

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \"Besides emptiness, Mahayana schools often place emphasis on the notions of perfected spiritual insight (prajñāpāramitā) and Buddha-nature (tathāgatagarbha). There are conflicting interpretations of the tathāgatagarbha in Mahāyāna thought. The idea may be traced to Abhidharma, and ultimately to statements of the Buddha in the Nikāyas. In Tibetan Buddhism, according to the Sakya school, tathāgatagarbha is the inseparability of the clarity and emptiness of one's mind. In Nyingma, tathāgatagarbha also generally refers to inseparability of the clarity and emptiness of one's mind. According to the Gelug school, it is the potential for sentient beings to awaken since they are empty (i.e. dependently originated). According to the Jonang school, it refers to the innate qualities of the mind that expresses themselves as omniscience etc. when adventitious obscurations are removed. The \"Tathāgatagarbha Sutras\" are a collection of Mahayana sutras that present a unique model of Buddha-nature. Even though this collection was generally ignored in India, East Asian Buddhism provides some significance to these texts.\"?\nAnswer:"

In truth, nothing equals the lightness, the sweetness with which the composer preludes on the piano; moreover nothing may be compared to his works full of originality, distinction and grace.\" Chopin refused to conform to a standard method of playing and believed that there was no set technique for playing well. His style was based extensively on his use of very independent finger technique. In his Projet de méthode he wrote: \"Everything is a matter of knowing good fingering ... we need no less to use the rest of the hand, the wrist, the forearm and the upper arm.\" He further stated: \"One needs only to study a certain position of the hand in relation to the keys to obtain with ease the most beautiful quality of sound, to know how to play short notes and long notes, and [to attain] unlimited dexterity.\" The consequences of this approach to technique in Chopin's music include the frequent use of the entire range of the keyboard, passages in double octaves and other chord groupings, swiftly repeated notes, the use of grace notes, and the use of contrasting rhythms (four against three, for example) between the hands.\"  Answer:\nAnswer:"

Answer according to: For some people with hip or knee pain, the words “joint replacement surgery” can be more frightening than just living with the discomfort. Will joint replacement surgery hurt? Will I be out of work or away from my daily activities for too long after surgery?\nRobotic technology for total joint replacements can help to ease some of those concerns, says Dr. Mark Peterson, an orthopedic surgeon with Adventist HealthCare Shady Grove Medical Center. He performed some of our region’s first total knee replacements using MAKOplasty® robotic technology at Shady Grove Medical Center in spring 2017.\n“Robotic total joint arthroplasty is a more precise way to implant total joints. It is exactly the same type of implant that is put in the traditional way. It just uses computer navigation to help with placement,” he says.\nWhat does this means for patients? In studies of the technology in 2015 and 2016, patients who underwent robotic surgery reported less pain and higher levels of activity than groups who underwent traditional joint replacement surgery.\n“This is due to less manipulation and dissection during surgery,” Dr. Peterson says.\nAll first-time joint replacement patients are candidates for MAKOplasty®. Shady Grove Medical Center is the only hospital in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, D.C., offering the technology for both total and partial replacements of hips and knees.\nWhether or not patients opt for robotic or traditional joint replacement, Shady Grove’s pre-surgery classes and support from a specialized team of nurses, therapists and other caregivers can help patients overcome any fears. In 2016, The Joint Commission again recognized Shady Grove for its quality outcomes in hip and knee replacement."

Boult was born in Chester, Cheshire, in North West England, the second child and only son of Cedric Randal Boult (1853–1950), and his wife Katharine Florence née Barman (d. 1927). Cedric Boult was a Justice of the Peace and a successful businessman connected with Liverpool shipping and the oil trade; Cedric and his family had \"a Liberal Unitarian outlook on public affairs\" with a history of philanthropy. When Boult was two years old the family moved to Blundellsands, where he was given a musical upbringing. From an early age he attended concerts in Liverpool, conducted mostly by Hans Richter. He was educated at Westminster School in London, where in his free time he attended concerts conducted by, among others, Sir Henry Wood, Claude Debussy, Arthur Nikisch, Fritz Steinbach, and Richard Strauss. His biographer, Michael Kennedy, writes, \"Few schoolboys can have attended as many performances by great artists as Boult heard between 1901 and October 1908, when he went up to Christ Church, Oxford.\" While still a schoolboy, Boult met the composer Edward Elgar through Frank Schuster, a family friend.At Christ Church college at Oxford, where he was an undergraduate from 1908 to 1912, Boult studied history but later switched to music, in which his mentor was the musical academic and conductor Hugh Allen. Among the musical friends he made at Oxford was Ralph Vaughan Williams, who became a lifelong friend. In 1909 Boult presented a paper to an Oxford musical group, the Oriana Society, entitled Some Notes on Performance, in which he laid down three precepts for an ideal performance: observance of the composer's wishes, clarity through emphasis on balance and structure, and the effect of music made without apparent effort. These guiding principles lasted throughout his career. He was president of the University Musical Club for the year 1910, but his interests were not wholly confined to music: he was a keen rower, stroking his college boat at Henley, and all his life he remained a member of the Leander Club.\nThe answer is:"

Article: Winter is dangerous because it's so difficult to know what is going to happen and accidents take place so easily. Fog can be waiting to meet you over the top of a hill. Ice might be hiding under the melting snow, waiting ahead to send you off the road. The car coming to you may suddenly slip across the road. Rule Number One for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly . Sudden movements can make a car very difficult to control. So every time you either start or stop your car, increase or reduce your speed, you must be as gentle and slow as possible. Suppose you are driving with a full cup of hot coffee on the seat next to you. Drive so that you wouldn't spill  it. Rule Number Two is to pay attention to what might happen. The more ice there is, the further down the road you have to look. Test how long it takes to gently stop your car. Remember that you may be driving more quickly than you think. Generally, allow twice of your usual stopping distance when the road is wet, three times this distance on snow, and even more on ice. Try to stay in control of your car at all times and you will not get into trouble. Question: The writer tries to  _  in this passage. Options: A: show his dislikes about bad winter weather B: give information about winter weather C: ask people not to drive in winter D: advise people about safe driving in winter\nThe answer is:"

        "prompt": "Article: Abscesses under the skin are very common in guinea pigs. They are the body’s attempt to ‘wall off’ an infection and keep it from spreading. Abscesses can form either after a bite from another guinea pig, or if something rough and sharp (e.g., straw) goes through the skin. They can form anywhere on a guinea pig’s body, but the most common locations are the head and neck.  An abscess in the neck could be a swelling of the lymph node in that area. Lymph nodes are small glands that help the body fight infection. An abscess can feel firm or soft. Abscesses can also form in the mouth or jaw of a guinea pig. Abscesses in these areas can become large very quickly. Your guinea pig may look fine on one day, then have a large abscess the next day. When you handle your guinea pig, gently open its mouth to see the abscess. If the abscess is in the jaw, you will see a large bump along your guinea pig’s jawline. Guinea pigs can get several types of cysts, with the most common being a sebaceous cyst. Sebaceous cysts contain oil from the skin glands that produce oil (sebaceous glands). Sebaceous cysts are typically located on a guinea pig’s back and near the rump, but can form in other places as well. Although they can become very large, cysts are usually about the size of a pea. Cysts become a problem if they become large. Tumors can also form lumps. For example, a lump on your guinea pig’s tail could indicate a skin tumor called trichofolliculoma.  A lump on the chest could indicate another type of cancer called lymphosarcoma.  A female guinea pig can develop a mammary tumor, which you would see as a lump on the belly.  Lipomas are tumors made up of fat cells. There are no specific places where you would look for a lipoma on your guinea pig. Your guinea pig may have several lipomas at one time. Sometimes, a lump can make a guinea pig feel so bad that it doesn’t want to eat. For example, if your guinea pig is not eating its meals and doesn’t want any tasty treats, check its mouth for an abscess. Even if your guinea pig wants to eat, the size of the abscess in its mouth or jaw could make it difficult to chew food. Sometimes, a guinea pig will stop eating right before an abscess ruptures (an abscess can sometimes rupture on its own). When you hold your guinea pig, take a quick sniff of its breath. If your guinea pig has a mouth abscess, its breath will probably smell quite unpleasant. The unpleasant smell would be due to infection. Along with bad breath, you may also notice drooling. An abscess can be very uncomfortable for a guinea pig. If your guinea pig squeals with pain when you pick it up, seems really tired, or doesn’t want to play with you, it could have an abscess. You may also notice your guinea pig heavily grooming the area of the abscess.\n\nWhat is a summary?"

        "prompt": "Question: I read this background article the other day: Huge amounts of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are applied to farm fields (see Figure below ). Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick.  I am facing a new situation today: There are two lakes in southern Indiana that are popular places for families of nearby cities to visit for picnics and parties. Lake Mahoe is right next to a large farm that grows all kinds of crops for the town. The owner of the farm also rents out his barn regularly so people can use it for celebrations. Lake Tresco is located near a school and children will often come play at it during recess.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Does lake Mahoe have more or less chemicals in it than lake Tresco?\nAnswer:"

Five men, criminals Ray, Dave, Stevie, Julian (\"Julie\" as a nickname), and Jason, plan a heist to steal a minimum of £2 million. Using a truck modified as a battering ram, the group break into a security depot in London and steal a large amount of money before the police arrive. However, they discover they barely got the amount of money they wanted, and only £68,000 to each man. Julian demands an extra amount of money as \"expenses\" for his work, but is beaten and placed in the boot of Ray's car until he just accepts his share. The group, without Julian, later spend time at a bar with fellow criminal Sonny, and Ray's girlfriend Connie, a protester. Ray and Stevie also visit an elderly couple, Linda and Bill, where they leave their stolen money for safekeeping. The next day, Ray and Stevie, who live together with Connie, are alerted by a bruised Dave that his money was stolen, apparently by Julian. Ray, Dave and Stevie investigate Linda and Bill's home to find them murdered and the money stolen, leaving Ray emotionally distraught. He visits Julian but his money is missing too. They conclude that Sonny stole the money and break into his house, only to find Jason dead with a headwound. The four are alerted to a pair of undercover police officers and flee, Dave and Julian engaging in a shootout with the police. Believing that he may be arrested for murder, Ray decides to flee after the money is found, and goes to his mother and Connie for help. His mother gives him some money and her car to use, disappointed in her son's career but still caring for him. Ray then speaks with Connie and asks her to come with him, and to meet her at a roadside service station on the M1 if she decides to come.\nAnswer:"

        "prompt": "Can you summarize the different types of thalassemia and how they affect the body?: Thalassemia is a blood disorder that causes mild or severe anemia (Antonio, 1993). This happens when people do not have enough hemoglobin and is caused by the inheritance of a defective gene (Nathan, 1998). Thalassemia is passed on from a parent to children through their genes (Simon, 1999). The name thalassemia comes from the Greek word \"thalassa\" meaning \"the sea\" because the condition was first described in populations living near the Mediterranean Sea (Nathan, 1998). However, the disease is also prevalent in Africa, Middle East, South Asia, and pacific descent (Simon, 1999). Moreover, thalassemia causes an immense disruption in the hemoglobin synthesis (Nathan, 1998). Although, there are two different types of thalassemia, alpha, and beta thalassemia they both affect the body.\nAlpha-thalassemia occurs most commonly in people from Southeast Asia and China (Ghosh, 1994). Its is caused when the hemoglobin does not produce enough alpha protein (Ghosh, 1994). The most severe form of alpha thalassemia causes (stillbirth, and death of fetus before delivery) (Ghosh, 1994).\nWhereas, beta thalassemia, is caused by a mutation in the beta globin chain (Nathan, 1998). Genes from both parents must be inherited to acquire the major form of this disease (Simon, 1999). In beta thalassemia major children are normal at birth, but develop anemia during the first year of life (Simon, 1999). The alpha and beta thalassemia's are distinct diseases that affect the body in different ways. Therefore, the symptoms of thalassemia, which are paleness, tiredness, dark urine, and spleen enlargement all, depend on the type and severity of the disease ( Simon, 1999).\nWriteWork contributors. \"Thalassemia\" WriteWork.com.

The district is noted for its annual high-school musicals. The elementary school (opened in 1953) is named after George A. Todd, Jr., who was the village's first teacher, first superintendent of schools, and taught for over 40 years. The middle school became a Blue Ribbon School in 2005.Briarcliff Manor has been home to a number of schools. Long Hill School was a public school in Scarborough until 1912, with about 70 students, two classrooms, and two teachers. Dr. Holbrook's Military School was on Holbrook Road from 1866 to 1915. Miss Tewksbury's School and later Mrs. Marshall's Day & Boarding School for Little Girls was at Dysart House. Miss Knox's School ran from 1905 in Pocantico Lodge, a hotel on Pleasantville Road under Briarcliff Lodge management.

Once aboard he seeks out his runaway wife, Julia (Barbara Stanwyck). He discovers she is trying to take their two unsuspecting children, 18-year-old Annette (Audrey Dalton) and ten-year-old Norman (Harper Carter), to her hometown of Mackinac, Michigan, to raise as down-to-earth Americans rather than rootless elitists like Richard himself. As the ship prepares for departure, her captain, E. J. Smith (Brian Aherne), receives a hint from the shipping company representative that a record-setting speedy passage would be welcomed. Other passengers include a wealthy woman of a working-class origin (based on a real-life Titanic survivor Molly Brown), Maude Young (Thelma Ritter); social-climbing Earl Meeker (Allyn Joslyn); a 20-year-old Purdue University tennis player, Gifford \"Giff\" Rogers (Robert Wagner); and George S. Healey (Richard Basehart), a Catholic priest who has been defrocked for alcoholism. When Annette learns her mother's intentions, she insists on returning to Europe with her father on the next ship as soon as they reach America. Julia concedes that her daughter is old enough to make her own decisions, but she insists on keeping custody of Norman. This angers Richard, forcing Julia to reveal that Norman is not his child, but rather the result of a one-night stand after one of their many bitter arguments. Upon hearing that, he agrees to give up all claim to Norman. Richard joins Maude, Earl, and George Widener in the lounge to play contract bridge with them. The next morning, when Norman reminds Richard about a shuffleboard game they had scheduled, Richard coldly brushes him off. Meanwhile Giff falls for Annette at first glance. At first she repulses his brash attempts to become better acquainted, but eventually she warms to him. That night, Giff, Annette and a group of young people sing and play the piano in the dining...

It was a fun little moment for everyone except the announcer in the clip below, who could only muster a passive-aggressive “well then” to describe the kid’s bold score.\nCompare that feed to the announcer on BT Sport in England, in which the announcer let out an enthused, “Ha!” along with a joke about the kid getting booked for ditching the shirt.\nOne of these guys needs to go announce cricket."

The project considers how women used knowledge about Zulu masculinity and the “patchwork of patriarchies” under which they lived as discourses to inform tactical interventions in rural struggles. Examining women’s motivations and strategies is significant because it reveals how gender and ethnicity shape the availability of violence as a political tactic and situates women at the forefront of violent actions that prompted liberation organizations to rethink tactics in the 1950s and early 1960s.\nMy first book, To Swim with Crocodiles: Land, Violence, and Belonging in South Africa, 1800-1996 (Michigan State University Press, 2018 and University of KwaZulu-Natal Press, forthcoming 2019), shows how Africans in the Table Mountain region of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, drew on the cultural inheritance of ukukhonza—a practice of affiliation that binds together chiefs and subjects—to seek social and physical security in times of war and upheaval. Grounded in a rich combination of archival sources and oral interviews, this book examines relations within and between chiefdoms to bring wider concerns of African studies into focus, including land, violence, chieftaincy, ethnic and nationalist politics, and development.\nHow does the cultural practice of ukukhonza provide social and physical security for Africans in the Table Mountain region of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa during times of war and upheaval?

Joyce, and Lt-Colonel Stewart Francis Newcombe. Herbert Garland was also involved. In addition, a French military mission commanded by Colonel Edouard Brémond was sent out. The French enjoyed an advantage over the British in that they included a number of Muslim officers such as Captain Muhammand Ould Ali Raho, Claude Prost, and Laurent Depui . Captain Rosario Pisani of the French Army, though not a Muslim, also played a notable role in the revolt as an engineering and artillery officer with the Arab Northern Army. The British government in Egypt sent a young officer, Captain T. E. Lawrence, to work with the Hashemite forces in the Hejaz in October 1916. The British historian David Murphy wrote that though Lawrence was just one out of many British and French officers serving in Arabia, historians often write as though it was Lawrence alone who represented the Allied cause in Arabia. David Hogarth credited Gertrude Bell for much of the success of the Arab Revolt. She had travelled extensively in the Middle East since 1888, after graduating from Oxford with a First in Modern History. Bell had met Sheikh Harb of the Howeitat in January 1914 and thus was able to provide a \"mass of information\" which was crucial to the success of Lawrence's occupation of Aqaba covering the \"tribal elements ranging between the Hejaz Railway and the Nefud, particularly about the Howeitat group.\" It was this information, Hogarth emphasized, which \"Lawrence, relying on her reports, made signal use of in the Arab campaigns of 1917 and 1918.\"\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: Which army had more Mulim officer, the English or the French?"

Back in the mid 1990s when I worked in Southern California, I was returning from lunch one day with a coworker when we noticed two pickup trucks driving erratically. This was on Valley View Blvd in Cerritos which is a large roadway divided (by a large, planted median strip) with 3 lanes on either side. One truck seemed to be chasing the other when suddenly the lead truck made a quick U-turn and was followed by the second truck. But the second truck came to stop just after making the turn. This was when the driver of that truck got out, walked to the front of his vehicle, raised his arm holding a semi-automatic handgun, paused, and then fired a single shot. At this point, I was parallel with the shooter’s truck and only about 50–60 feet from where he was standing. I remember my coworker exclaiming, “Oh sh*t! Did he just shoot at the something?!” I floored my accelerator and sped off to my workplace which was about a 1/2 mile down Valley View Blvd. I parked and my coworker and I got into the building as quickly as we could. While he started telling our other coworkers about what we had just witnessed, I ran to my desk, called 911, and reported the shooting. The dispatcher kept me on the line after my initial report and then transferred me to a detective in order to take down my information. As it turns out, my information and the fact that I called 911 immediately resulted in the arrest of the shooter. I was later asked to testify in court which resulted in the shooters conviction. I lived in Southern California for 10 years and now I drive a commercial truck several days a week so I have PLENTY of other “road rage stories”, but this is still the craziest one. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: How long did it take the driver to get to his workplace? Options: - one minute - not enough information - one year - one day\n"

The men are trouble makers and rebels, but are able to perform well. The men are sent out to blow up a bridge and manage to destroy the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) guards. However, another NVA force arrives and an all out battle commences. During the battle, two of the men are killed, but the team kills off all of the NVA reinforcements and captures their leader.

Despite the NVA plan of ambush, the NVA are wiped out, but they manage to kill two of the women and one of the special squad. Realizing that there is little time, the squad goes on with their mission and finds the fort. Their squad leader goes inside the fort to recon and is captured.

The measure, approved by a 256-167 vote, now goes to the Senate, which has until midnight Friday to approve it and avert the year’s third government closure. The massive bipartisan bill would keep the government funded until the end of September. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. Under Senate rules, a single senator can delay the vote but not stop it entirely. Senator Rand Paul has objected to the short time given to members to read the lengthy legislation. As of Thursday afternoon, the Senate was waiting to see how the vote would proceed, raising the prospect of another brief government shutdown.  With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill will consider major legislation this year. The measure would fulfill President Donald Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill, which the White House said Trump supports, would give Trump a huge budget increase for the military, including a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. “Today marks the beginning of a new era for the United States military,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement Thursday. “This legislation fulfills our pledge to rebuild the United States military.” After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides $1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers (93 miles) of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the $25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost.

The victims are often women and their children and they frequently have few resources with which to pursue their legal rights,\" Trout said Tuesday. \"This campaign helps fill that gap in legal services for women who need the help at a time when they are in crisis.\" The Idaho Partners for Justice Project has already secured pledges of more than $35,000 from law firms, attorneys, corporations and individuals. The goal is $100,000. The drive to pay for free legal services will continue for the next two months. The money goes to Idaho Legal Aid Services and the Idaho Volunteer Lawyers Program.

The Commodore PET, Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore 64 are some home computers produced while he was running the company. Tramiel later formed Atari Corporation after he purchased the remnants of the original Atari, Inc. from its parent company.  - Atari Interactive is a name used by several separate groups and corporations since the mid- 1990s . In 1996 , it was the name of Atari Corporation 's PC publishing division , bringing games like the Atari Jaguar 's Tempest 2000 to the PC platform . From 1998 to 2001 , Atari Interactive , Inc. was the name of the corporate entity that held the Atari properties purchased from JTS by Hasbro in 1998 , and functioned as the retro publishing subsidiary of Hasbro Interactive . It is currently the name of a wholly owned subsidiary of Atari , SA ( formerly Infogrames ) , who is the current owner of the Atari brand and various other properties formerly belonging to Hasbro Interactive . It was formed in 2001 , when IESA acquired Hasbro Interactive and proceeded to rename it to Infogrames Interactive . In 2003 , IESA then changed the company name entirely to Atari Interactive , Inc. as part of its world wide reorganization to focus on use of the Atari brand .  - Hasbro Interactive was an American video game production and publishing subsidiary of Hasbro, the large game and toy company. Several of its studios were closed in early 2000 and most of its properties were sold to Infogrames which completed its studio's closures in 2001. History. Hasbro Interactive was formed late in 1995 in order to compete in the video game arena. Several Hasbro properties, such as Monopoly and Scrabble, had already been made into successful video games by licensees such as Virgin Interactive. With Hasbro's game experience, video games seemed like a natural extension of the company and a good opportunity for revenue growth. Hasbro Interactive's objective was to develop and publish games based on Hasbro property and the subsidiary existed for six years.  - Atari, SA (ASA) is an international French holding company headquartered in Paris, France. It was originally called Infogrames Entertainment, SA (IESA). Its subsidiaries include Atari London Studio, Atari Interactive and Atari, Inc.. Because of continuing pressures upon the company, and difficulty finding investors, it sought bankruptcy protection under French law in January 2013; its subsidiaries in the United States have sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection there as well. All three subsidiaries have since exited bankruptcy, and are all going through a vigorous turnaround campaign.  - Tempest 2000 is a 1994 remake by Jeff Minter of the Dave Theurer 1981 arcade game, \"Tempest\". Originally an exclusive to the Atari Jaguar, the game has since been released on PC, Macintosh, PlayStation, and the Saturn. The game received critical praise for its 3D graphics, soundtrack, and gameplay.  - The Atari Jaguar is a home video game console that was developed by Atari Corporation. The console was the sixth and last programmable console to be developed under the Atari brand, originally released in North America in November 1993. Controversially, Atari marketed the Jaguar as being the first 64-bit video game console, while competing with the existing 16-bit consoles (Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo Entertainment System) and the 32-bit 3DO Interactive Multiplayer platform (which launched the same year).  - Hasbro, Inc. (an abbreviation of its original name, Hassenfeld Brothers) is an American multinational toy and board game company. Hasbro is the third largest toy maker in the world with revenues of approximately $4.45 billion. Hasbro acquired the trademarks and products of Kenner, Parker Brothers and Milton Bradley, among others. Among its toy and game products are the iconic Monopoly board game, G.I. Joe figurine, Furby electronic stuffed animal and Transformers mechanical toys. The Hasbro brand also spawned TV shows, such as \"Family Game Night\" on the Discovery Family network, to promote its products. The corporate headquarters is located in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. The majority of its products are manufactured in East Asia.  - Jeff 'Yak' Minter (born in 22 April 1962 in Reading) is an independent English video game designer and programmer. He is the founder of software house Llamasoft and has created dozens of games during his career. Minter's games are often arcade style shoot 'em ups. They often contain titular or in-game references demonstrating his fondness of ruminants (llamas, sheep, camels, etc.). Many of his programs also feature something of a psychedelic element, as in some of the earliest \"light synthesizer\" programs including his \"Trip-a-Tron\".  - Atari, Inc. was an American video game developer and home computer company founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney. Primarily responsible for the formation of the video arcade and modern video game industries, the company was closed and its assets split in 1984 as a direct result of the North American video game crash of 1983.  - An arcade game or coin-op is a coin-operated entertainment machine typically installed in public businesses such as restaurants, bars and amusement arcades. Most arcade games are video games, pinball machines, electro-mechanical games, redemption games or merchandisers. While exact dates are debated, the golden age of arcade video games is usually defined as a period beginning sometime in the late 1970s and ending sometime in the mid-1980s. Excluding a brief resurgence in the early 1990s, the arcade industry subsequently declined in the Western hemisphere as competing home-based video game consoles such as Playstation and Xbox increased in their graphics and game-play capability and decreased in cost.  - The Atari ST is a line of home computers from Atari Corporation and the successor to the Atari 8-bit family. The initial ST model, the 520ST, saw limited release in the spring of 1985 and was widely available in July. The Atari ST is the first personal computer to come with a bit-mapped color GUI, using a version of Digital Research's GEM released in February 1985. The 1040ST, released in 1986, is the first personal computer to ship with a megabyte of RAM in the base configuration and also the first with a cost-per-kilobyte of less than US$1.  - Paris (French: ) is the capital and most populous city of France.

He established Atari, Inc. and the Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza-Time Theaters chain. Bushnell has been inducted into the Video Game Hall of Fame and the Consumer Electronics Association Hall of Fame, received the BAFTA Fellowship and the Nations Restaurant News Innovator of the Year award, and was named one of \"Newsweek\"s \"50 Men Who Changed America.\" Bushnell has started more than twenty companies and is one of the founding fathers of the video game industry. He is currently on the board of Anti-Aging Games, but his latest venture is an educational software company called Brainrush that is using video game technology in educational software, incorporating real brain science, in a way that Bushnell believes will fundamentally change education. Nolan, who is co-founder and chairman of Brainrush, believes that Brainrush will be his biggest success.  - Atari Corporation was an American manufacturer of computers and video game consoles from 1984 to 1996. Atari Corp. was founded in July 1984 when Warner Communications sold the home computing and game console divisions of Atari, Inc. to Jack Tramiel. Its chief products were the Atari ST, , Atari 7800, Atari Lynx, and Atari Jaguar. The company reverse merged with JTS Inc. in 1996, becoming a small division, which itself closed when JTS liquidated the IP to Hasbro Interactive in 1998.  - The Atari Lynx is a 16-bit handheld game console that was released by Atari Corporation in September 1989 in North America, and in Europe and Japan in 1990. The Lynx holds the distinction of being the world's first handheld electronic game with a color LCD. The system is also notable for its forward-looking features, advanced graphics, and ambidextrous layout. The Lynx competed with the Game Boy (released just 2 months earlier), as well as the Game Gear and TurboExpress, both released the following year. It was discontinued when Atari was acquired by Hasbro Interactive in 1995.  - A toy is an item that is generally used for children's play. Playing with toys is supposed to be an enjoyable means of training young children for life in society. Different materials like wood, clay, paper, and plastic are used to make toys. Many items are designed to serve as toys, but goods produced for other purposes can also be used. For instance, a small child may fold an ordinary piece of paper into an airplane shape and \"fly it.\"  Newer forms of toys include interactive digital entertainment. Some toys are produced primarily as collector's items and are intended for display only.   - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.  - Atari is a corporate and brand name owned by several entities since its inception in 1972, currently by Atari Interactive, a subsidiary of the French publisher Atari, SA (ASA). The original Atari, Inc. founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney was a pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles, and home computers. The company's products, such as \"Pong\" and the Atari 2600, helped define the electronic entertainment industry from the 1970s to the mid-1980s.  - David \"Dave\" Theurer is a game designer. In 1980, he created \"Missile Command\", considered one of the great classic video games from the Golden age of arcade games. Another pioneering achievement, also in 1980, was \"Tempest\". Theurer also designed \"I, Robot\", the first commercial video game with filled 3-D polygonal graphics. All three were released by Atari.  - Infogrames Entertainment, SA (IESA) was an international French holding company headquartered in Lyon, France. It was the owner of Atari, Inc., headquartered in New York City, U.S. and Atari Europe. It was founded in 1983 by Bruno Bonnell and Christophe Sapet using the proceeds from an introductory computer book.

        "prompt": "What is a one-sentence summary of the following article?\nOne of the first complaints presented to doctors by many people later diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease is an involuntary tremor or shaking of the hands, fingers, arms, legs, jaw, and face. You’re most likely to notice this tremor when your hands are at rest rather than when you’re using them, although you may see more tremors while your hands and arms are in use as the disease progresses.  There are many causes of tremors. Parkinson's Disease is one of the most common causes, and tremors are often the first sign of the disease. The tremor and other symptoms may initially appear only on one side of the body, or they may appear worse on one side than the other. A repetitive “pill-rolling\" movement between the thumb and finger—named because it looks as though the person is rolling a pill between their fingers—is characteristic of a Parkinsonian tremor. Some symptoms of Parkinson's are caused by the larger symptom of slowed movements (also known as bradykinesia). This primarily affects motor functions from walking and balance to writing and even motor functions that are often considered reflexive or spontaneous.  These slowed movements are a very common early sign of Parkinson’s, and may show up at the onset of the disease in 80% of patients. Some people might have a hard time describing what they are feeling and use words like “weakness,” “tiredness,” or “incoordination” when talking about these symptoms. Look for distortions in voluntary movements. In addition to involuntary movements, those with Parkinson’s may experience disturbances in their voluntary movements beyond just slowness. Some of the treatments used for Parkinson's disease may cause abnormal involuntary movements, or an increase in movement, referred to as dyskinesia. These distortions (dyskinesias) can be similar to a “tic” in appearance and worsen with psychological stress. Advanced dyskinesia is most often seen in patients who have been on the medication Levodopa for some time. A common symptom of Parkinson’s is a shuffling gait with short steps and a tendency to lean forward. People with Parkinson's often have difficulty with their balance, and there is sometimes a tendency to fall forward, causing the person to walk faster and faster to keep from falling over. This pattern is called a \"festinating gait,\" and it is very common in Parkinson's disease. This symptom typically shows up in the later stages of the disease. Those with Parkinson’s Disease often lean forward at the waist when standing or walking. This is because Parkinson's can cause posture and balance problems, including rigidity. There is a tendency to flex the arms and the head so that the person appears bent over with the elbows flexed and the head down.  Rigidity can affect the whole body, and might you feel stiff or sore. Check for postural rigidity. Also referred to as “cog-wheeling,” this symptom presents as a hallmark, rigid motion when an examiner moves the arm of a patient through basic flexion and extension motions. The rigidity and resistance to movement is most obvious with passive movement of the wrists and elbow. Cog-wheeling may happen when the increased muscle tone related to rigidity is combined with a tremor. Some cognitive impairment is common, but usually not until late in the course of the disease. Around 90% of those with PD will show signs of speech disturbances at some point. These can present as quieter speech, breathy or hoarse qualities to the voice, and reduced precision with language. The voice often becomes soft or whispery because the vocal muscles lack mobility. Up to 60% of those with PD may show signs or anxiety or depression. PD affects some of the mood-stabilizing portions of the brain, which leads to this increased chance for depression, especially paired with the quality of life for patients in late stages of the disease. The muscles used to push food through the digestive system are also affected by PD. This can lead to a variety of gastrointestinal issues from incontinence to constipation. These same symptoms often present along with difficulty swallowing food as well. Many of the involuntary movements associated with Parkinson’s make it increasingly difficult for those with the disease to get a full night of sleep. Other symptoms—such as muscle rigidity making it difficult to roll over at night or bladder issues leading to getting up at night to urinate frequently—compound the sleep disruptions experienced by those with PD.\n\nSummary:"

        "prompt": "What is a one-sentence summary of the following article?\nYou could go directly into the confessional (provided there's no one else in there or waiting outside), but sometimes it's nice to take a minute in the pew by yourself beforehand. You have this beautiful church probably almost all to yourself. Can you feel its energy resonating through you? Can you feel the majesty of the Lord's kingdom and how you're a part of it? Take a moment to kneel and pray with your head down and hands clasped together. Reflect on your faith and how you feel currently. Think about how you've been responding to God's call and how you've been living in the light of his love. When the priest is ready for you, of course. You'll probably see him there by his lonesome or someone else walk out just before you. Sit down either across from him or behind the screen -- it's totally up to you whether or not you prefer to remain anonymous. He won't treat you any differently either way. Make the sign of the cross upon his prompt, saying, \"Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.  It has been (blank) since my last confession.\" This is your standard, traditional phrasing. However, if you just sit down and say hello, that's fine, too. The priest knows what he's doing. The Byzantine Rite is a bit different. The priest may sit to your side and put his epitrachelion on your head. He may then also do the Prayer of Absolution. But the idea remains the exact same -- just go wherever he takes you. Once you sit down and you've made the sign of the cross, just sit back and follow the priest's lead. He'll ask you how long it's been since your last confession (if you don't voluntarily offer that information), how you are feeling, maybe how your faith is going, and then ask you what sins you would like to talk about with him and God. It's just a casual conversation! Do not fret. There is absolutely zero pressure on your part. Again, as long as you come there with the intention of leaving with a clean heart, you're more than welcome in the church. There is no wrong way to go about confession! This part is intimidating, but think about it this way: the priest you're talking to has probably heard just about everything before. Whatever you have to say will not blow his mind. So when he asks, start rattling them off, from the most serious to the least. If he asks any questions, answer them, but do not feel the need to go into detail. A simple, \"I did so and so,\" will suffice. Your priest is going to be very understanding. If you don't remember the exact timeframe, that's fine. If you don't remember your motivation, that's fine. All your priest cares about is that you're being as honest as possible and that your heart is in the right place. He'll talk you through everything, possibly asking about your intentions, but mainly just letting you know that God loves you, sin and all. If he has any ideas to bring you closer to God, he may suggest them at this juncture. He's there to help, after all. He will then ask you to make an Act of Contrition. That goes like this:  My God, I am sorry for my sins with all my heart.In choosing to do wrong and failing to do good,I have sinned against You whom I should loveabove all things. I firmly intend, with your help,to do penance, to sin no more, andto avoid whatever leads me to sin.Our Savior Jesus Christ suffered and died for us.In his name, my God, have mercy  (If you are a Roman Catholic, your act of contrition will go like this: Oh my God, I am very sorry for having offended thee. I detest all of my sins because of thy just punishment. But most of all, because they offend you, my God, who is all good and deserving of all my love. I firmly resolve with the help of thy grace, to sin no more, and to avoid the near occasion of sin. Amen. Don't worry! It won't be anything huge. You may even walk away just having to say a few meaningful prayers. Take the absolution to heart -- you now have a brand new, clean slate to work with. It'll feel so uplifting! Just to clarify, \"absolution\" means your sins are washed away. \"Penance\" is your expression of regret and repentance, showing God that you're truly sorry for what you've done and that you wish for nothing more than to be forgiven.\n\nSummary:"

        "prompt": "It looks like WWE stars John Cena, 41, and Nikki Bella, 34, are indeed over this time, and Cena, at least, has no regrets.\nWhen news of their breakup first hit, many people believed it might be part of Bella’s reality TV show, Total Bellas. However, according to a TMZ report, the two tell their real-life friends that the breakup wasn’t staged and that they merely grew apart due to being apart so much. In fact, while Bella filmed her show, Cena was away in China, which didn’t help their relationship.\nSo far, Bella isn’t looking for a new beau just yet, but she is looking for a new place to live. For now, she’s focused on her career and finding a place to call her own.\nOn the season finale of Total Bellas last night, Bella called off her engagement for the second time just weeks before she planned to walk down the aisle to say “I do” to Cena. The first time they broke up, it was over not having children, but Cena agreed to reverse his vasectomy to attempt to have a child, but ultimately, that didn’t turn out to be the solution to all the couple’s problems.\nIt sounds like the two WWE wrestlers have nothing but respect for each other, but have decided it is time to part ways after their six-year relationship. For Bella’s part, she admitted on her show that she’s completely exhausted at this point and has to move on to other things. Cena, too, appears to be happy enough with what he’s learned from the relationship if his tweet is any indication. Based on the passage above, What was the reason for the second breakup between John Cena and Nikki Bella, as shown on Total Bellas?"

As the entity responsible for the branding of the business, a corporate office may be much more responsive to consumer complaints.  Do an internet search on the business and look for their corporate contact information. Send an email or a letter to the appropriate person. Make sure to be polite and clearly articulate the problem or issue. Call the corporate entity and ask for customer service or the customer complaint department. Be polite and clearly explain the problem. Say something like “Hello, I was a guest at your location in Boston’s Back Bay. I was extremely disappointed with the service and cleanliness offered there. I feel taken advantage of.” If you booked the hotel through a travel or booking website, you may be able to complain directly to that business.  Be prepared to be put on hold for potentially long periods of time when contacting booking website customer service. Clearly articulate your complaint. Have your transaction number or receipt at hand. Be able to provide evidence, such as photographs, police reports, or the names of customer service representatives at the hotel. Be aware that hotel or travel booking websites are very often unresponsive to customer complaints. This owes to their high volume and slim margins on individual transactions. If the booking business is unable to resolve your complaint, your last recourse is to post a negative review about the hotel in question on their website. Depending on your complaint, you should consider contacting the relevant regulatory body. As government agencies that oversee businesses that offer public accommodations, they’ll be able to deal with and issue appropriate sanctions.  If you’re complaining about a health and sanitation issue, contact the local health department. Consider contacting the state or province’s division or department of hotels and restaurants. If your complaint is serious enough, the licensing agent may take action or launch an investigation into the hotel in question.\n\nSummary:"

        "prompt": "Given the question: Information:  - \"Don't Think I Can't Love You\" is a song co-written and recorded by American country music artist Jake Owen. It was released in August 2008 as the fourth single release of his career, and the lead single from his album \"Easy Does It\". Owen wrote the song with Kendal Marvel and Jimmy Ritchey.  - \"Eight Second Ride\" is a song co-written and recorded by American country music singer Jake Owen. It was released in June 2009 as the fifth single of Owen's career, and the second single from album \"Easy Does It\". Owen had previously recorded the song on his 2006 debut album \"Startin' with Me\". Owen wrote this song with Eric Durrance.  - Country music is a genre of United States popular music that originated in the southern United States in the 1920s. It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \"country music\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \"hillbilly music\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \"country music\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States.  - `` Something About a Woman '' is a song co-written and recorded by American country music artist Jake Owen . It was released in August 2007 as the third and final single from his debut CD Startin ' with Me . Owen wrote this song with Bob Regan and Jimmy Ritchey .  - \"Anywhere with You\" is a song recorded by American country music artist Jake Owen.

This album produced three singles, all of which reached top 20 on the \"Billboard\" Hot Country Songs chart: his debut single \"Yee Haw,\" \"Startin' with Me,\" and \"Something About a Woman.\" A second studio album, 2009's \"Easy Does It,\" has accounted for three more singles: \"Don't Think I Can't Love You,\" \"Eight Second Ride,\" and \"Tell Me.\" In September 2011, Owen achieved his first number one hit on the country charts with the title track to his third studio album \"Barefoot Blue Jean Night,\" as did with \"Alone with You,\" \"The One That Got Away,\" and \"Anywhere with You.\" His fourth studio album, \"Days of Gold\" produced two singles with its title track, which broke the top 20 in 2014, and the number one single \"Beachin'.\"  - Startin' with Me is the debut album of country music artist Jake Owen, released in July 2006 (see 2006 in country music) on RCA Records Nashville. Singles released from the album include \"Yee Haw\", the title track, and \"Something About a Woman\", all of which have charted on the \"Billboard\" Hot Country Songs charts. \"Yee Haw\", the first of these three, reached number 16, \"Startin' with Me\" was the highest-peaking, at number 6, and \"Something About a Woman\" peaked at number 15.  - RCA Records is an American major record label owned by Sony Music Entertainment (SME).

He will be subject to fine.\n''At this point, I don`t think I`m going to be there. I would rather hold out now than do it during training camp,'' said Singletary.\nSingletary signed a six-year contract in 1983 that started in 1984. But the average pay of $276,000 a year, including bonus, became obsolete in Singletary`s mind as soon as Wilber Marshall became the Bears` No. 1 draft choice in 1984. Marshall signed for approximately twice Singletary`s salary.\nSingletary`s agent, Tom Williams, has been discussing a restructuring of the contract with Bears` general manager Jerry Vainisi, but the Bears prefer a policy of no renegotiation. They called quarterback Jim McMahon`s new contract before last season an extension rather than a renegotiation.\n''We`ve talked, but we haven`t agreed on anything yet,'' said Vainisi.\nSingletary, a valuable cog in the No. 1 defense in football, is considered a model athlete for his work habits and leadership. He is a two-time Pro Bowl starter and was named Defensive Player of the Year last season by United Press International.\nUnlike free-agent defensive starters Todd Bell and Al Harris, Singletary is under contract and therefore subject to fine if he misses the mini-camp.\n''I prefer to do it this way. Better now than later,'' said Singletary."

But for the first Navy SEALs that would have been something of a luxury as they landed on beaches in the dark on two-man motorised rafts dubbed 'flying mattresses'. Often members were only armed with knives and wore nothing but swimming trunks and flippers as they carried out seaborne clandestine missions during the Second World War. Scroll down for video. Two combat swimmers from the Maritime Unit of the Office of Strategic Services can been seen during a training exercise in 1944, where they are on one of the raft's dubbed a 'flying mattress' in just their trunks. Frank Monteleone, 89, was a member of an elite commando force within the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) - the precursor to the CIA. Created after the United States entered Second World War, the OSS pioneered many of the intelligence-gathering techniques and commando-style tactics used by today's U.S. Special Forces. The spy agency's Maritime Unit, formed in 1943, shares the credit for setting the foundation for what would become the Navy SEALs, created during the Kennedy administration in 1962. Head of the OSS, William 'Wild Bill' Donovan - a Wall Street lawyer - recruited yachtsmen, Olympic-calibre swimmers and California's 'beach rats' - lifeguards and surfers. The son of Italian immigrants, Mr Monteleone was recruited by the OSS because he spoke fluent Italian and was trained as a Navy radio operator. He said he went through 'all kinds of training' with the services, including demolition and hand-to-hand combat, but had missed out on parachute training - a must for any OSS operator. Frank Monteleone, 89, was a member of an elite commando force within the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) Once in the Mediterranean Theatre of operations, his detachment was assigned to the British Eighth Army. Mr Monteleone, now a retired tailor living in Staten Island, New York, said: 'When they sent me to the British, they wanted to know if I had jump training. I said no, and they gave it to me right then and there.' He explained how he conducted dangerous missions nearly the entire length of Italy, from the beaches at Anzio to the Alps, often working with Italian partisans behind the lines. Some of the missions entailed landing on beaches at night using the inflated craft that resembled mattresses and were powered by silent electrical motors. Mr Monteleone and his Italian comrades named the teardrop-shaped vessel 'tartuga,' which is Italian for turtle. Combat swimmer Lt. John Booth is seen wearing a rebreather, a precursor to SCUBA during a training exercise and features in new book, 'First SEALs: The Untold Story of the Forging of America's Most Elite Unit' Members of the combat swimmers and other operatives conduct an operation in the South Pacific in 1945  to provide reconnaissance and demolition missions that allowed the Navy to land on key islands during the war. His story along with others is told in a new book entitled 'First SEALS: The Untold Story of the Forging of America's Most Elite Unit' and reveals what it was like to be a member of the early commando force. Its release comes as a member of the SEAL team that killed Osama bin Laden in 2011 chose to waive his anonymity and went public with his role in taking down the terrorist leader in Pakistan. Frank Monteleone, centre, pictured with other members of the Maritime Unit, attached to the British Eighth Army. Rob O'Neill, a highly-decorated veteran who quit after 16 years service, has chosen to given an interview to Fox News - due to be broadcast later this month. O'Neill claims to be 'The Shooter' and said he shot him three times 'just for luck'. The book's author, Patrick K. O'Donnell said he had always wanted to write a book on the early Navy SEALs. 'The bin Laden raid was sort of the culmination of what all these men had built from 1943 to 1945,' he said. O'Donnell, who has written eight previous books on Second World War military and intelligence history, had met Mr Monteleone 15 years ago while researching a book on the OSS. Speaking of Mr Monteleone's role in the war, he said: 'The radio operator was the key to the mission. If you could not send and receive information on missions behind the lines, you were dead.' Approximately 13,000 people served in the OSS during the war, but only a few hundred were in the Maritime Unit and O'Donnell believes Mr Monteleone may be one of the last still living. Another member included in the book is Gordon Soltau, a combat swimmer considered one of the Navy's first 'frogmen.' Mr Soltau, who starred for the San Francisco 49ers during the 1950s, died in California at 89 on October 26, just days before the new book was published. Rob O'Neill (left) has waived his right to anonymity and claims to be 'The Shooter' that killed al Qaeda leader, Osama bin Laden in a raid on his compound in Pakistan (right) in 2011.

The number 114 is significant because it recognizes the 114,000 plus patients still waiting for organ donations in the country.\nThis was followed by chaplain Beachy stressing the importance of organ donation. He stated that he has multiple family members who have benefited from organ donations themselves.\nLori Knitt, Vice President of Nursing at Aurora Sheboygan said this is not unique. Many of the medical providers and thus the community have been impacted by organ donations.\nAccording to hospital officials, as of Jan. 2018, 56.2 percent of drivers and ID holders in the county have registered to be donors. The statewide average is 57 percent.\n\"Not everyone can be an organ donor, depending on the circumstances that brought them to us,\" Knitt said. \"So the more eligible pool of candidates, the better.\"\nTo become an organ donor, you can join the Wisconsin Organ & Tissue Donor Registry or you can sign up when you renew your license at your local Department of Motor Vehicles."

Based on the passage above, Could you list the modifications made to the existing services contract between Ecuadorian authorities and ENAP Sipetrol related to the exploration and development of Block 47, and the investment sum committed by the Chilean-owned company under the new agreement?"

A 2015 analysis by the Aluminum Association and the Can Manufacturers Institute determined that if all of the aluminum cans in the U.S. Were recycled, we could power four million homes and save $800 million per year. Aluminum cans are also the most valuable to recycling companies, with a value of $1,491 per ton compared to $385 per ton for PET plastic. “Cans are recycled at the highest rates, and drive recycling programs across the country because of the high value of aluminum compared to other packaging materials,” said Heidi Brock, President and CEO of the Aluminum Association.\n“Our biggest concern and our biggest challenge today is municipal solid waste and contamination in our inbound stream,” James Delvin, CEO of ReCommunity Recycling, which operates 31 facilities in 14 states, told Green is Good Radio. “It’s an economic issue if you think about we go through all this effort to process this material, and roughly 15 to 20 percent of what we process ends up going back to the landfill. It’s incredibly inefficient to do that.” In a 2014 survey by the National Waste and Recycling Association, nearly one in 10 Americans admitted to throwing their waste in recycling bins when trash cans were full; one in five said they will place an item in a recycling container even if they are not completely sure it is recyclable.

Over four hundred members of the alumni came to attend the meet from various parts of the country.

The day-long affair had a host of activities lined up for the ex-students, who not only devoured the buffet but enjoyed challenging each other to games of badminton, billiard, chess and carom among other things. After this, SY Kulkarni, principal, MSRIT, thanked the contributions of all donors and urged them to continue supporting the college in whatever way they could. “For a change, we wanted an outing for the entire family so that they could also meet the teachers and friends. We’ve always had the alumni meets on campus but we wanted to give more freedom to the ex-students this time and everybody welcomed the break from the routine. Given the number of people who showed up, it was quite a success. It wasn’t really nostalgic but a dream come true.

To decompose the question, think of a decomposition strategy you could apply to answer the question through a search against Wikipedia. The decomposition strategy might not be obvious for some questions. For this reason, you are provided with additional information. You are not required to write decompositions that exactly match the provided facts, they are only meant as guidance. If the facts are too noisy, think about how you would have used Wikipedia to answer this question to create the decomposition. \"not_definitive_answer\" is true if there is no clear answer i.e. the question is ambiguous or a subjective opinion.\"incorrect_answer\" is true if the answer to the question is not correct. If the answer is incorrect, write a decomposition that evaluates the correct answer. Each question should be easy to answer based on simple facts from Wikipedia pages, or a simple check using the answers to preceding questions. To ensure this, we also ask you to enter a potential Wikipedia article that would contain the answer to each question. If you can not think of a Wikipedia page that can answer your question, please think of a different strategy. You do not need to enter a Wikipedia page for steps that don't add new information and only contain simple checks. The answer to the final question is the same as the answer to the original question. Every question's answer has an impact on the final answer and there should be no redundant steps in the decomposition.\nProblem:Question: Do sun bears stay active during winter?, Answer:Yes, Description of Sun bear: bear found in tropical forest habitats of Southeast Asia, Fact1: The sun bear is a species in the family Ursidae occurring in the tropical forests of Southeast Asia., Fact2:  Sun bears do not seem to hibernate., Fact3: Hibernation is a seasonal heterothermy characterized by low body-temperature, slow breathing and heart-rate, and low metabolic rate.

One day in autumn, when she rides her bicycle to school through the forest, she observes a hunting fox. Of course, the fox escapes, but the girl yearns to meet the animal again. She spends most of her free time in the forests trying to find the fox during the following months, but she doesn't meet the fox again until winter comes. During the winter, she follows the fox's tracks far across the fields. Suddenly she compares her hand to the size of the tracks near to those she is following and discovers they are relatively fresh wolf tracks; she is alarmed as a wolf pack begins howling near her. She runs away panicked, falls and hurts her ankle. The ankle heals very slowly, so that she has to stay at home during the winter reading a book about foxes and other animals of the forest. When spring arrives, the girl is looking for fox holes and waits for the fox. The fox has young babies and moves holes because of her observations; therefore the girl decides to observe the fox from a greater distance. She finds the fox again and tries to get the animal accustomed to her. She feeds it with meat. Later she can even touch the fox and is led to the new den. Finally, the fox arrives at her house and she lets it inside, wanting to show it her bedroom. But the fox becomes distressed at not being able to find a way out and escapes by smashing through her brittle plate glass window, causing the glass to shatter. The fox is hurt badly, but survives and the girl learns that she cannot keep wild animals as pets at home as they are unpredictable and may break more things such as fragile glass windows. Years later she tells the whole story to her son, as seen at the end of the film. Some versions (DVD English) leave out this scene and put the gist of its text over the scene before it.\nThe answer is:"

It deletes configuration by querying all of the configuration objects (trigger routers, routers, group links, etc) and removing each one. The problem is that the query uses a select with all the columns known in the current version, which doesn't work on an older database. Change the approach to just delete all rows from configuration tables instead of querying them, which will be faster anyway."

Both Mark and Paul were powerfully moved by what they saw, experienced and learnt.\nWe saw tremendous adversity and great challenges, we witnessed great courage and optimism, and we learnt that each of us has a responsibility and obligation to do what we can to make a difference”.\nMark and Paul had difficulty reconciling what they saw at Sishemo. They were compelled to act – to pool their resources and engage their network of friends, families and colleagues to ‘make a mark’ and help empower impoverished children through improved access to education.\nThat night, in a Lusaka hotel, inspired by the children of Sishemo and driven by an enthusiasm and commitment to lend a hand to children in need, saw the beginning of Make A Mark Australia – ‘MAMA’.\nWe have all thought at various times about doing more to help those less fortunate than ourselves, but sometimes it’s hard to know how. This is where MAMA, through its targeted grass-roots funding model, provides an avenue for us to empower children through improved access to education and economic independence. When you look deeply into the eyes of child with hope, you can see a world full of dreams – a better world."

In the 1920s, he was associated with the New Objectivity (\"Neue Sachlichkeit\"), an outgrowth of Expressionism that opposed its introverted emotionalism.  - Alexander Kanoldt ( 29 September 1881 -- 24 January 1939 ) was a German magic realist painter and one of the artists of the New Objectivity . Kanoldt was born in Karlsruhe . His father was the painter Edmond Kanoldt , a late practitioner of the Nazarene style . After studies at the Academy of Fine Arts Karlsruhe in Karlsruhe he went to Munich in 1908 , where he met a number of modernists such as Alexei Jawlensky , Wassily Kandinsky and Gabriele Münter . He became a member of the Munich New Secession in 1913 , with Jawlensky and Paul Klee . After military service in World War I from 1914 to 1918 , the still lifes Kanoldt painted show the influence of Derain and an adaptation of cubist ideas . By the early 1920s Kanoldt developed the manner for which he is best known , a magic realist rendering of potted plants , angular tins , fruit and mugs on tabletops . He also painted portraits in the same severe style , as well as geometrical landscapes . In 1925 he was made a professor at Breslau Academy , a post he held until 1931 . During this time he came into conflict with the Bauhaus faction at the Academy , and he was increasingly at odds with the avant garde . From 1933 until his resignation in 1936 he was the director of the State School of Art in Berlin . With the rise of the Nazi regime in 1933 Kanoldt attempted accommodation , painting in a romantic style , but nonetheless many of his works were seized by the authorities as degenerate art in 1937 . He died in Berlin in 1939 .  - George Grosz (July 26, 1893  July 6, 1959) was a German artist known especially for his caricatural drawings and paintings of Berlin life in the 1920s. He was a prominent member of the Berlin Dada and New Objectivity group during the Weimar Republic. He emigrated to the United States in 1933, and became a naturalized citizen in 1938. Abandoning the style and subject matter of his earlier work, he exhibited regularly and taught for many years at the Art Students League of New York. In 1956 he returned to Berlin where he died.  - The New Objectivity (in ) was a movement in German art that arose during the 1920s as a reaction against expressionism. The term was coined by Gustav Friedrich Hartlaub, the director of the in Mannheim, who used it as the title of an art exhibition staged in 1925 to showcase artists who were working in a post-expressionist spirit.  As these artistswho included Max Beckmann, Otto Dix, and George Groszrejected the self-involvement and romantic longings of the expressionists, Weimar intellectuals in general made a call to arms for public collaboration, engagement, and rejection of romantic idealism.

If you’re Prince Charles, you guest-edit a British weekly that celebrates the bucolic lifestyle and culture of the country’s farmland communities. But of course.\nThe Prince of Wales, who celebrates his birthday on Nov. 14, plans to edit the Nov. 13 issue of Country Life that will feature an exclusive interview with His Royal Highness.\nPrince Charles is expected to meet with the editorial board to discuss his duties, but since the magazine, the self-anointed “Home of Premium Property,” generally concerns the joys of rural landowners and their homes, Charles likely has some thoughts to spare on those matters.\nIn the same way that Judd Apatow lent his eye and ear for comedic talent to Vanity Fair‘s December comedy issue, so too can Charles bless Country Life with his innate genteel manner. He and his wife Camilla live part-time in Highgrove House, an estate in the Cotswolds that seems tailor-made for a Country Life cover or feature. He could also share thoughts on his favorite pastimes — the ones that aren’t weather forecasting or deejaying — such as watercolor painting and, until an injury, polo. If his personal interests prove too inconsequential, he can always shed light on his manifold humanitarian pursuits. The Prince of Wales is a longtime champion of organic farming, climate-change research and historical preservation — all of which would gel nicely with Country Life’s rural bent."

Movie title: Hondo Movie plot: The story takes place at some point between 1869 and 1877 (It is mentioned in the dialogue that Ulysses S. Grant is President). At a remote ranch in the Arizona Territory, homesteader Angie Lowe (Geraldine Page) and her six-year-old son Johnny (Lee Aaker) come upon a stranger (John Wayne) on foot, carrying only his saddle bags and a rifle. The man tells them only his last name, Lane, and that he was riding dispatch for the US Army Cavalry. He had lost his horse in an encounter with some Indians. Angie tells Lane her ranch hand had quit before he had a chance to break her two horses for riding, so Lane offers to break a horse himself. He asks where her husband is, and she says he is rounding up cattle in the mountains and should return soon. Lane deduces from the neglected ranch that her husband has been away for some time, a fact she confesses is true. When night falls Angie offers to let Lane sleep in her home. Angie sees his rifle is inscribed \"Hondo\" Lane, whom she knows had killed three men the year before. She attempts to shoot him, but due to the first chamber being empty, Hondo is not hurt. He loads the chamber and tells her to keep it that way. Hondo returns to his Cavalry post, where he meets up with his friend Buffalo Baker (Ward Bond). He reports to his commanding officer that C troop, which was sent to gather and bring in settlers to the north, was killed by Apaches. It is clear to the Major (Paul Fix) that the Apaches are raiding and killing settlers. At the ranch, Angie and Johnny are beset by Apaches, led by Chief Vittoro (Michael Pate) and his main under-chief, Silva (Rodolfo Acosta). Angie is not nervous in their presence as they have never attacked her family before. This time, they begin manhandling Angie. Johnny emerges from the house with the pistol and shoots at Silva. As Silva recovers and approaches him, he throws the pistol at Silva. Vittoro is impressed by Johnny's bravery and makes him an Apache blood brother.

Having appeared as a regular on Another World at age 10, her breakthrough came in Disney Pictures' The Parent Trap (1998).\n\nIn July 2007, Lohan's home was burgled by the Bling Ring, a group of fashion-motivated burglars whose ringleader considered Lohan to be their ultimate conquest. Video surveillance of the burglary recorded at Lohan's home played a large role in breaking the case.  During the 2008 US presidential campaign, Lohan offered her services to Barack Obama's Democratic election effort, but was declined. In a blog post, Lohan criticized the media and then Republican Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin for not focusing on policy, and attacked Palin's positions on homosexuality, birth control and abortion. Lohan had previously expressed an interest in going to Iraq, during the Iraq War in 2006, on a USO tour with Hillary Clinton. In the 2012 presidential election, Lohan supported Republican candidate Mitt Romney, something that prompted ABC News to call her a \"political turncoat\". Only weeks later, she tweeted words supportive of Obama.  Speaking about her sexual orientation, Lohan said that she was not a lesbian. When asked if she was bisexual in 2008, she responded \"Maybe. Yeah,\" adding, \"I don't want to classify myself.\" However, in a 2013 interview, she said, \"I know I'm straight. I have made out with girls before, and I had a relationship with a girl. ... I think I was looking for something different.\"  In April 2016, Lohan was studying Islam and considered converting.  In October 2017, Lohan received scrutiny for defending Harvey Weinstein, whom she worked with on several films, on Instagram and saying that his wife Georgina Chapman should stay with him. Weinstein had been accused of sexual harassment and sexual assault.\n\nUsing a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What are some controversys Lohan has been involved with?"

We don’t yet know why the Christie administration engaged in this corruption, who else was involved, who might yet turn on whom, and when the next shoe might drop.\nAnd with all this intrigue surrounding one of the GOP’s highest-profile figures, the nation’s highest-ranking Republican official made the funniest comment of his professional career.\nUm, no. Actually, it’s not time to move on. Ordinarily, it’s time to move on when all of the relevant questions have been answered, not when all of the relevant questions remain unanswered.\n* 20 new subpoenas are going out.\n* The Senate Transportation Committee received information from the Port Authority, and found “no evidence” to support the “traffic study” excuse still being touted by Christie last week.\n* The state Assembly has begun its new legislative session by creating a special investigatory committee to oversee the probe into the scandal. As Rachel noted on the show last night, it will be led in part by former federal prosecutor Reid Schar, who helped convict former Illinois Gov.

It was a three person show, and one of the roles was written specifically for me. Many of the lines were written after we improvised the scenes in my living room as she wrote the piece. Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, “It says you have already played this role.” I said, “Yes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.” She looked at me like I was lying. I mean, shuttled me out the door like I was a crazy woman. Needless to say, I was not called back. And that was okay—(I mean, of course I wanted to do the show with this group of people, but hey, we can’t always get what we want). Fast forward to opening night: my playwright friend invites me to see the show. The actress playing “my” role was fantastic, but they had to change lines in the script that indicated what she looked like, because she was of Hawaiian descent. Again, no big deal…and she was great! What was strange was meeting the director that evening. My friend introduced me as the originator of the role, and the director asked me why I hadn’t auditioned…Overall, it wasn’t a harsh rejection or a terrible story, it was just weird to have been treated like a liar when I was not lying… Why did the actress feel bad about begin rejected?  A. Because she thought the other actress did a bad job  B. Because she was treated like a liar  C. not enough information  D. Because the role had to be changed for the new actress\nAnswer:"

The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän.  - Northern Europe is the northern part or region of Europe. Although no definitive borders or definition exists for the term, geographically, Northern Europe may be considered to consist approximately of all of Europe above the 52nd parallel north; which includes (from west to east) most or all of: Iceland, the Republic of Ireland, the Isle of Man, the United Kingdom, the Faroe Islands, the Netherlands, northern Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, northern Poland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and northwest Russia. However, narrower definitions may also be used based on other geographical factors, such as climate and ecology. Greenland, geographically a part of North America, is politically a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and may be included depending on the definition.  - Halmstad Municipality (\"Halmstads kommun\") is a municipality in Halland County on the Swedish west coast, in which the city Halmstad is the seat.  - Timber framing and \"post-and-beam\" construction are methods of building with heavy timbers rather than dimensional lumber such as 2x4s. Traditional timber framing is the method of creating structures using heavy squared-off and carefully fitted and joined timbers with joints secured by large wooden pegs (larger versions of the mortise and tenon joints in furniture). It is commonplace in wooden buildings from the 19th century and earlier. The method comes from making things out of logs and tree trunks without modern high tech saws to cut lumber from the starting material stock. Using axes, adzes, and draw knives, hand-powered auger drill bits (brace and bit), and laborious woodworking, artisans or farmers could gradually assemble a building capable of bearing heavy weight without excessive use of interior space given over to vertical support posts. Since this building method has been used for thousands of years in many parts of the world, many styles of historic framing have developed. These styles are often categorized by the type of foundation, walls, how and where the beams intersect, the use of curved timbers, and the roof framing details. Three basic types of timber frames in English-speaking countries are the box frame, cruck frame, and aisled frame.  - Finland , officially the Republic of Finland, is a sovereign state in Northern Europe. A peninsula with the Gulf of Finland to the south and the Gulf of Bothnia to the west, the country has land borders with Sweden to the northwest, Norway to the north, and Russia to the east. Estonia is south of the country across the Gulf of Finland. Finland is a Nordic country situated in the geographical region of Fennoscandia, which also includes Scandinavia. Finland's population is 5.5 million (2014), staying roughly on the same level over the past two decades. The majority of the population is concentrated in the southern region. In terms of area, it is the eighth largest country in Europe and the most sparsely populated country in the European Union.  - Halmstad is a port, university, industrial and recreational city at the mouth of Nissan in the province of Halland on the Swedish west coast. Halmstad is the seat of Halmstad Municipality and the capital of Halland County. The city had a population of 92,797 in 2012, out of a municipal total of over 90,000 (18th most populous - 2012). Halmstad is Sweden's 20th-largest city by population and located about midway between Gothenburg (the second most populous) and Malmö (the third). It is Europe's northernmost city with a lot of timber framing architecture.  - Denmark is a Scandinavian country in Europe. The southernmost and smallest of the Nordic countries, it is south-west of Sweden and south of Norway, and bordered to the south by Germany. The Kingdom of Denmark is the sovereign state that comprises Denmark proper and two autonomous constituent countries in the North Atlantic Ocean: the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Denmark has a total area of , and a population of 5.7 million. The country consists of a peninsula, Jutland, and an archipelago of 443 named islands, with the largest being Zealand and Funen. The islands are characterised by flat, arable land and sandy coasts, low elevation and a temperate climate.  - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country.
